          <p>
          Born and raised in San Diego, California. Jannah has always been a true and proud Californian. Even when 
          attending university at the University of California, Irvine, she has never strayed too far from her home. 
          <br> 
          She graduated from UCI with a major in pharmaceutical sciences and a minor in economics. Jannah has always worked in
          a pharmacy related setting, but when it was time to head to pharmacy school, she declined and experienced what
          some would call a quarter-life crisis.
          <br> 
          For the past three years, Jannah has worked as a Native English Teacher and Lecturer in 
          Seoul, South Korea and Tokyo, Japan. Her time in these big cities has opened her eyes to the importance
          of web and app development and how it is incorporated into the everyday lives of people around the world. 
          Since then, Jannah has been working as technical support at a innovative insulin pump company, but aspires to 
          learn more about the coding world.
          When she's not trying out new food places or sleeping, catch her on some hikes or at the movies.
